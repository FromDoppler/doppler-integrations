# Unbounce integration for Doppler
 
## Publish a new version

To publish and run your application:

* Make sure that Visual Studio is building the Release version of your application. If necessary, change the build configuration setting on the toolbar from **Debug** to **Release**.

* Right-click on the **Doppler.Integrations** project (not the HelloWorld solution) and select **Publish** from the menu. You can also select **Publish** from the main Visual Studio **Build** menu.

* Once the Publish finished you will have all the files that you have to deploy on the Doppler Server.

* The last step is to copy all the new files inside of the Doppler Server. 

## Unbounce configuration

We have created a document which shows the different steps that the user should follow to use the integration.
